# bs-fontawesome

## Introduction

Bucklescript + ReasonReact binding for [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) components. I write bindings when I needed them in my projects. 
If you find a component is missing, it's because I don't need it (yet).

Cautionary note that I am very new to bindings so confirmation and testing is necessary for anything you want to use as I only tested what I use.
** See [bs-ant-design](https://github.com/thangngoc89/bs-ant-design) repo for original credit on this pattern. **

## Installation
```
npm install --save bs-fontawesome
```

* Add `bs-fontawesome` to `bs-dependencies` in `bsconfig.json`.


## Usage
```
<FontAwesomeIcon icon=["fal", "comments"] className="fa-5x" />
```

## Components

I did the components I needed.  While I usually made an attempt to do all the params technically, I only tested the
ones I needed.  Assume you will need to test everything you want to use well.

## Contributions

All contributions are welcomed.  I intend to merge and release anything you push quickly.
